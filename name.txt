Since I get this question often, let me write it out here. My name "Homanga" is NOT a typical Indian name. It is probably not a typical name in any culture/region.
In fact I have never met anyone with this name. I will update this page if/when I do. "Homanga" is a combination of two Sanskrit words and it means "part of a flame."

I frankly won't mind if you address me as anything as long as I understand you are referring to me. But I would appreciate it 
if you use the pronouns "he/him" if possible. Also, there are some names I prefer more than others:::

The list is in decreasing order of preference.

0. Manga (only if you are feeling like it. I bet you can't adress me as Manga without audibly chuckling)
1. Homanga
2. Bharadhwaj (I challenge you to pronounce it)
3. Ho (nice and short)
4. Maan (some of my friends and relatives call me this. In Sanskrit "Maan" translates to "respect." I don't claim to be worthy of it.)
5. Homanga Bharadhwaj (I know. Some people like to address me with my complete name)

I would appreciate it if you can avoid calling me these:

6. Mr. Homanga
7. Mr. Bharadhwaj
8. Mr. Homanga Bharadhwaj
9. Sir/Monsieur/Signore/Se√±or/Herr/Mahoday/...

Also, I request you to not address me as "Dr./Professor" atleast until I become one. I will conspicuously update my website when I do.
